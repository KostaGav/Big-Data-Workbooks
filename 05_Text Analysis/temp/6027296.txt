major challenge mammalian brain development identify extracellular ligands receptors direct assembly complex wiring pattern brain recent modification gene trap technique embryonic stem cells secretory trap allows systematic trapping genes encoding ligands receptors generation mice harboring mutations genes providing important tool elucidate functions genes however problem studying brain wiring extremely difficult identify changes wiring resulting experimental perturbation difficulty tracing axonal projections neurons particular usually extremely difficult identify wiring defects mutant mice whether mutation arose spontaneously generated gene targeting insertional mutagenesis conceived modification gene trap technique dramatically facilitate identification characterization receptors involved wiring mammalian nervous system method histochemical axonal marker targeted neurons normally express trapped gene enables direct visualization connections made neurons direct visualization wiring defects homozygous mutant animals simple histochemical stain way role trapped gene brain wiring rapidly assessed equal importance great benefit neuroscience community large method also simultaneously result generation bank mice expressing histochemical marker different populations axons provide important tool researchers interested elucidating normal pattern neuronal connections mammalian brain request made support isolation large number secretory trap es cell lines using modified vector proposed 80 lines per year put germ line expression phenotypic analysis identify involved wiring nervous system provide resource mice expressing axonal marker different populations neurons use neuroscience community expect method help greatly accelerate pace discovery mechanisms direct wiring mammalian nervous system
