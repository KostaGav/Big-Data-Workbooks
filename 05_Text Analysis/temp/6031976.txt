chemical senses taste olfaction play important role human life loss many diseases consequence chemotherapy contributes significantly deterioration quality life even though role pheromones humans still poorly understood recent progress demonstrated existence human pheromones suggests role underestimated past fruit fly drosophila melanogaster arguably best studied multicellular animal provides many practical advantages chemical senses discovered two malespecific proteins expressed chemosensory organs suggesting may involved recognition female pheromones males function cells two proteins expressed tested using directed cell ablation test function proteins generate null mutants determine response female pheromones longterm goal work use drosophila model system gain greater understanding pheromone response likely implications understanding human chemical senses response pheromones particular
