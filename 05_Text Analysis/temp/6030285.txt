denatured state protein implicated number disease states plays functionally important role biologically important process transport across membranes protein degradation protein folding longterm goal work elucidate thermodynamic properties denatured ensemble thereby understand properties relate compactness denatured state denaturation gibbs energy changes used assessing stability proteins focus class proteins whose denatured ensembles continue change thermodynamic characters function denaturant concentration variable thermodynamic behavior denatured ensembles proteins contrasts dramatically fixed behavior exhibited proteins whose denatured ensembles change thermodynamic properties function denaturant potentiometric titrations native denatured ensembles well proton uptakerelease measurements used 1 distinguish variable fixed thermodynamic behavior denatured ensembles 2 provide modelindependent means evaluating gibbs energy differences native andor denatured states proteins related sequences size exclusion chromatography also used correlate dimensional changes denatured ensemble ensemble s thermodynamic properties function denaturant concentration ultimate aim provide strong foundation thermodynamic measurements protein stability foundation present weak invalid many proteins
