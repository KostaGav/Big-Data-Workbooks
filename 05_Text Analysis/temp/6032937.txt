linkage disequilibrium nonrandom association alleles linked loci used gene mapping technique refine location disease susceptibility locus designing linkage disequilibrium received little attention recent statistics literature particularly cost available sample size limited address issues proposing two twostage designs optimal design one maximizes power chance identifying true disease susceptibility locus first design evaluated total cost constraint given number markers goal determine optimal allocation sample size twostage process consider second design constraints total cost available sample size goal design determine number markers genotyped twostage process intermarker spacing provide optimal design finally derive critical value test statistics two designs first obtain approximation power function critical value two proposed designs use monte carlo simulations investigate values affected choice total number markers intermarker distance total sample size increased attention whole genome designs proposed permit researchers allocate limited resources manner whereby power identify disease susceptibility locus maximized
