longterm goal current research understand neural pathways mechanisms underlying motivated behaviors specifically mediate expression male sexual behavior male sexual behavior complex behavior dependent intrinsic external factors much research focused role olfactory hormonal signals much less known influence genitosensory hormonal signals much less known influence genitosensory cues control male sexual behavior aim present proposal delineate neural pathway genitosensory input related population reaches motivation centers forebrain investigate functional role pathway male sexual behavior previous work laboratory demonstrated existence neural subcircuit forebrain specifically related ejaculation male rats preliminary work provided strong evidence candidate pathway may relay ejaculationspecific genitosensory input subcircuit pathway includes subset neurons lumbar spinal cord specific thalamic nucleus turn forebrain regions critical sexual behavior current proposal confirm existence pathway address three additional questions 1 peripheral nerves interneurons convey genitosensory information male reproductive organs lumbar spinal cord 2 pathway convey genitosensory stimuli associated specifically ejaculation 3 relay genitosensory information critical expression male sexual behavior shed light issue long standing interest fascination namely neurobiological basis sexual pleasure proposed focusing pathway conveying afferent genitosensory information fill crucial gap understanding motivational circuitry mediating sexual behavior since neural mechanisms controlling ejaculation humans similar rat results relevance understanding human sexual dysfunction may contribute development new therapeutic approaches
