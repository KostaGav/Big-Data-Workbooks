longrange goal research determine fundamental mechanisms information processing central neurons neurons mammalian cns receive information synaptic input located predominately within dendritic arborizations dendrites thousands excitatory inhibitory synaptic inputs blended together form coherent output response known dendritic integration morphology active membrane properties neuronal dendrites therefore play important role processing incoming synaptic activity synaptic input widely spread across dendritic arborizations type processing performed dendrites vary dramatically function exact location synapse potentially large locationdependent synaptic variability shown detrimental effects processing capabilities neurons sought investigate role dendritic voltagegated ion channels might reducing locationdependent synaptic variability several lines preliminary evidence indicate contrary theoretical expectations minimal locationdependence individual components dendritic integration unitary epsp amplitude spatial summation temporal summation furthermore preliminarily observed properties dendrites responsible lack location dependence finally begun show reducing intrinsic locationdependence dendritic processing active properties dendrites improve functional capabilities ca1 pyramidal neurons thus central hypotheses tested dendritic ion channels reduce locationdependence synaptic input hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neurons improving computational properties proposed provide thorough understanding mechanisms involved integration synaptic activity within dendrites therefore fundamentally advance understanding neuronal function
