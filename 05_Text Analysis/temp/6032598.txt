overall goal proposal determine role fractalkine vascular disease fractalkine novel chemokine expressed activated endothelial cells recent data indicates binds cells expressing fractalkine receptor cx3cr1 high affinity thus unlike chemokines fractalkine appears function chemoattractant also adhesion molecule cell adhesion properties fractalkine may due unique architecture virtually known chemokines secreted proteins contrast fractalkine transmembrane domain protein chemokinelike domain located top mucin stalk recently found fractalkine captures cells flowing physiologically relevant shear stress extremely rapidly high efficiency specific aim 1 use novel cell adhesion assay quantitatively compare binding cx3cr1expressing cells fractalkine integrinmediated cell adhesion specific aim 2 identify domains within fractalkine critical mediating highaffinity adhesion cx3cr1expressing cells create novel chimeras chemokines substituted chemokinelike domain fractalkine using assays developed specific aim 1 determine whether unique cellbinding properties fractalkine due presentation chemokinelike domain top rigid stalk unique properties chemokine specific aim 3 create cx3cr1 knockout mice directly assess role fractalkine vascular disease breed mice appropriate genetic backgrounds test hypothesis fractalkine plays important role two human diseases require capture leukocytes rapidly flowing blood atherosclerosis glomerulonephritis proposed grant use novel quantitative vitro assays creation fractalkine receptor knockout mouse provide significant new information role fractalkine vascular disease
