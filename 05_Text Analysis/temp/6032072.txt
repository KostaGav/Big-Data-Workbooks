cytosine methylation epigenetic modification dna plays key role cellular memory throughout eukaryotes important several epigenetic gene regulatory systems including parental genomic imprinting xchromosome inactivation silencing transposons multiple copy dnas methylation also plays role tumor cell biology tumors often show genome wide demethylation hypermethylation specific genes despite importance little known proper methylation patterns established maintained longterm goal proposed research use arabidopsis thaliana model genetic system identify genes involved proper genomic methylation patterning arabidopsis one best organisms type given ability largescale mutagenesis given international arabidopsis genome sequencing efforts given collection methylation mutants cloned dna methyltransferase genes already available discovered manipulable epigenetic system methylation state two key floral regulatory genes superman agamous altered several mutations affect overall genomic methylation surprisingly find mutations reduce overall genomic methylation cause dense hypermethylation superman agamous furthermore discovered new class mutations also cause dense overmethylation superman locus affect overall genomic methylation levels specific objectives proposal 1 map mutations cause hypermethylation superman goal cloning corresponding genes 2 use large scale mutagenesis identify genes important maintaining dense patterns methylation superman 3 role superman methylation normal development 4 determine cis acting sequences cause targeting superman methylation given likelihood genomic methylation mechanisms conserved plants mammals plant gene hypermethylation may well shed light similar processes occurring animals especially superficially similar phenomenon hypermethylation genes cancerous cells
