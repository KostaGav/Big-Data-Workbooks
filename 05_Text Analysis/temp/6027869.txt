estrogen receptors ligandinducible transcription factors critical progression breast cancers estrogen antagonist tamoxifen used treat breast carcinomas blocking hormone binding although tamoxifen chemotherapy beneficial drug causes endometrial uterine cancer serious side effect results inability tamoxifen fully inhibit function cell nucleus longterm objective research focuses development novel paradigm total blockage function paradigm based utilizing synthetic ligands prohibit nuclear localization proposed research test following hypothesis since affect transcription cell nucleus novel synthetic ligands recruit plasma membrane fully inhibit hermediated transcriptional activation hypothesis tested evaluation chemical synthesis chimeric ligands distinct herbinding membranebinding domains surface plasmon resonance measurements membrane anchoring functionality chimeric ligands herligand complexes utilized investigate membrane affinities vitro furthermore chimeric ligands analyzed vivo transcriptional reporter gene assays green fluorescent protein assays subcellular localization preliminary work already demonstrated 7alphasubstituted betaestradiol ligands efficiently synthesized b herpromoted reporter gene expression vivo abolished genetically fusing ras membrane targeting sequence thus ras membrane targeting provides much stronger directing force nuclear localization signals data suggest synthetic ligands target plasma membrane may confer total hormonal blockage thereby providing effective antiestrogen therapeutics strategy proposed herein potential provide novel approach nuclear hormone receptor antagonism
