major question neuroscience differences neuronal phenotype achieved maintained acquisition mature differentiated properties takes place extended period intrinsic cell programs activitydependent processes last several years laboratory asked whether differences neuronal cell surface proteins might parallel structural functional properties earlier work described one cell surface protein expressed functionally related subsets neurons central visual areas current period additional members family identified addition new experimental approaches developed permit function cell surface proteins studied major goal understand regulation expression function cell surface proteins differentially expressed neuron central visual areas proposed work three specific aims 1 determine neuronal surface proteoglycans play role synapse formation neuronal chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans cspgs expressed surface restricted subsets neurons neuronal cell membrane distributed nonsynaptic regions excluded regions synaptic contact proposed ask neuronal cspgs determine sites initial synapse formation 2 investigate activity regulates expression neuronal cspgs acquisition normal levels neuronal cell surface cspgs adult animals requires normal pattern activity early life regulation cell surface cspgs early activity parallels regulation structural functional properties neurons early activity role neurotransmitter receptors growth factors regulating expression cspgs tested 3 clone gene neuronal cell surface proteoglycans neuronal cell surface proteoglycans show remarkable degree heterogeneity celltype specificity determine genetic basis heterogeneity understand molecular mechanisms underlying celltype specific expression activitydependent regulation genes encoding neuronal genes encoding neural cspgs cline longterm goal understand cellular molecular mechanisms could aid recovery neurological ophthalmological diseases injury
