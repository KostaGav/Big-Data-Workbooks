long term goal research understand molecular basis controlling cell differentiation skeleton particular emphasis osteoblast lineage cbfa1 known transcription factor whose presence absolutely required osteoblast differentiation embryogenesis proposed application aim identifying cisacting elements transacting factors controlling cbfa1 expression believe knowledge lead better understanding molecular mechanisms inducing cell commitment differentiation along osteoblast lineage therefore osteogenesis turn help design new therapeutic approaches treatment genetic degenerative diseases caused impaired osteoblast differentiation function specific aims delineate osteoblastspecific cisacting element present proximal 22kb cbfa1 promoter fragment perform dnabinding assays identify transcription factors binding cellspecific cisacting elements present 22kb cbfa1 promoter fragment analyze function 22kb cbfa1 proximal promoter cisacting elements contains transgenic mice identify cellspecific enhancer elements located outside 22kb proximal cbfa1 promoter
