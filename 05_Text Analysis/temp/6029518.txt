salmonellosis represents serious global problem incidence infection continues increase worldwide despite expensive research changes production processing levels long term goal control salmonella infection humans animals develop salmonellabased vaccines deliver heterologous antigens objective outlined proposal elucidate genetic regulation salmonella genes whose products required invasion salmonella bacteria invade host cell secrete effector proteins via type iii secretion system translocated host cell importantly secretion system shown effective delivery system viral epitopes host cell cytosol hence developed use vaccines viral antigens tumorspecific antigens understanding regulation genes involved type iii secretion enable us design efficacious vaccine strains optimally deliver heterologous antigens specifically identify genes encode proteins regulating inva gene invasion regulator inr genes ii determine inr proteins regulation invasion genes encoded salmonella pathogenicity island iii identify genes regulated inr determine fi required virulence salmonella approach involve using variety genetic molecular biology techniques identify mutants show altered expression invasion genes mutants used identify additional virulence genes salmonella mutants generated evaluated using tissue cultured animal models
